# 03713_HMM_Model

Code for detecting transcriptional start sites using deep learning and machine learning techniques. Features were calculated based on the DNA dimer structural properties. The convolutional neural network and support vector machine performed well when tested against randomly generated background sequences, but did not perform better than random when tested with randomly sampled DNA sequences as the negative sample. This may be due to the higher GC content of transcriptional start sites, which makes it distinct from random sequences but not from sampled sequences.
